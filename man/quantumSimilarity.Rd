\usage{
quantumSimilarity(
  word_a,
  word_b,
  gallitoCode,
  spaceName,
  neutral_state = TRUE,
  state
)
}
\arguments{
\item{word_a}{The first word the function will evaluate.}

\item{word_b}{The second word the function will evaluate.}

\item{gallitoCode}{Gallito API password to extract information from the LSA semantic space.}

\item{spaceName}{Gallito API LSA semantic space you want to use}

\item{neutral_state}{By default the function will take the neutral state between the two words subspaces
to evaluate the similarity}

\item{state}{The initial state the function will use to calculate the similarity between the two words in case
`neutral_state = FALSE`.}
}
\value{
The function will return a value between 0 and 1 indicating the similarity between the two words.
}
\description{
quantumSimilarity is a function that takes two words and a state vector and returns the quantum
similarity between them. To see more details about the quantum similarity go to Pothos and Busemeyer (2011).
