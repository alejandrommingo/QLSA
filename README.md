# QLSA

This is the first version of the QLSA R package. This package was created for academic proposals. 

Quantum Latent Semantic Analysis (QLSA) is an R package used in the UAM research team. We have created a new method for generating multidimensional subspaces of concepts extracted from a LSA semantic space.
The LSA semantic space is allocated in the Gallito API tool server. For that reason you will need to use a password in order to use this package. Please, don't hesitate in contacting us if you want to use it for academic proposals.

You will need to install the "devtools" package in order to install the "QLSA" package.
Follow the next steps to install our package:

* 1. Install "devtools" in your R session: `install.packages("devtools")`
* 2. Open the "devtools" library: `library(devtools)`
* 3. Install the "QLSA" package using the "install_github()" function: `install_github("amartinezm90/QLSA")`
